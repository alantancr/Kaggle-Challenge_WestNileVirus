# West Nile Virus

## Problem Statement



## Executive Summary

We have performed modelling with ExtraTrees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost classifier. Through this modelling process, we have scored the performance of the various models on Kaggle. Based on the highest ROC-AUC score, we have selected ExtraTrees Classifier as our model.



|                            | ExtraTrees | Random Forest | XGBoost |  SVM  |
| :------------------------: | :--------: | :-----------: | :-----: | :---: |
|       ROC-AUC Score        |   0.745    |     0.737     |  0.724  | 0.715 |
| Performance on Unseen Data |   0.687    |     0.669     |  0.683  | 0.642 |



## Process

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Modelling
4. Model Evaluation
5. Conclusion
6. Cost-Benefit Analysis



## Limitation & Recommendation



Spray data provided were bounded to 2011 and 2013.  The evaluation of spray effectiveness are constraint due to limited dates.



## Conclusion

Based on our study, we had a reasonable prediction of WNV presence by trap. By performing cost-benefit analysis, we uncovered the estimated cost for spray versus medical cost and productivity loss in the public. Asides that, West Nile Virus is not the only disease which mosquitoes carries. We encourage that public needs to be aware of other diseases which mosquitoes carries and its health threats
